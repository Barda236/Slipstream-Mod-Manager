Drop any .ftl files here and restart Slipstream in order to be able to patch them in.

The last-used order is remembered with modorder.txt, if it exists here.


"Beginning Scrap Advantage" is a simple example mod. All it does is give you some extra scrap when you first start a game. Rename .ftl to .zip and extract it in order to study it further.


"Engi Scrap Advantage" is another example mod demonstrating advanced XML tags to chain-load existing events. All it does is give you some extra scrap when you enter an Engi sector.

See also: "readme_modders.txt".

Those special tags require Slipstream Mod Manager 1.2+.
